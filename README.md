# **Floptimizer - Windows Optimizer**
### Windows batch script to optimize gaming performance, network connection, latency, input lag and change some other stuff for windows.
Script itself has variety of tabs you can choose from by the number from 1 to 6 (for now).

Credits to FrameSync Labs and other sources that benchmarked a lot of stuff that are inside of the script, feel free to check on the internet and ask ai to verify commands, because this isn't a virus!
This was made from people for people!!
