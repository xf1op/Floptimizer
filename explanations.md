| **Network Auto-Tuning** | is a Windows feature that automatically adjusts how much data your system can receive over a network to improve speed and efficiency. If disabled it will improve internet bufferbloat. |
| **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** | is a lightweight internet protocol that sends data quickly without checking if it arrives correctly. It’s great for real-time tasks like gaming or streaming, where speed matters more than perfect delivery. |
| **Network Throttling Index** | is a Windows setting that controls how fast your computer processes network data, especially during multimedia tasks like gaming or video playback. Tweaking it can help reduce lag and improve online performance by allowing more bandwidth to flow without limits. |
| **HID Service (Human Interface Device Service)** | is a Windows feature that lets your computer communicate with input devices like keyboards, mice, and game controllers. Users (and FrameSync Labs) say that it decreases input lag if disabled. |
| **Idle Demote/Promote Thresholds** | control how your CPU shifts between deeper or lighter sleep states. Lower thresholds can make the CPU more responsive, while higher ones save more power. |
| **Core Parking Minimum Cores** | sets the least number of CPU cores that must stay active. Raising it keeps more cores ready, which can reduce lag but use more energy. |
| **Link State Power Management** | adjusts how PCIe devices (like your GPU) save power when idle. Turning it off can improve performance, especially in gaming, but may use more battery. |
| **HPET (High Precision Event Timer)** | is a hardware timer in modern computers that helps the system keep track of time with high accuracy. Disabling HPET on AMD (especial Ryzen) CPUs can improve performance and reduce stutter, while on Intel CPUs it often has minimal effect and may cause instability on older generations. |
| **Game Mode** | is a feature that prioritizes system resources for gaming by limiting background activity and focusing CPU and GPU power on your game. It's proven it **decreases** performance while it's enabled. |
| **HAGS (Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling)** | is a Windows feature that lets your graphics card manage its own memory and task queue, instead of relying on the CPU. Disabling it improves gaming performance. |
| **Game DVR** | is a Windows feature that lets you record gameplay, take screenshots, and save highlights using the Xbox Game Bar. It runs in the background and can automatically capture your last moments in a game, but it impacts performance. |
| **Win32PrioritySeparation (Priority Separation)** | is a Windows registry setting that determines how the operating system prioritizes foreground and background processes. This setting allows users to control the allocation of CPU resources between applications that are actively being used (foreground) and those running in the background. 2 is default in windows system, 36 gives the most priority to foreground leading to big performance gains (especially 1% low). |
| **SystemResponsiveness** | is a Windows registry setting that controls how much CPU power is reserved for background tasks. Lowering its value (like from default 14 to 10 - minimum possible) can make foreground apps—such as games or real-time software—run more smoothly by giving them more CPU priority. |
